# Data structures & Algorithms
This repo holds my implementations for common data structures, algorithms, and other popular interview questions in C and Python.

## Running
You will need [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) to be able to run the tests. After ensuring that you have the library installed, run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kamui-7/dsa.git
make
./run_tests.sh
